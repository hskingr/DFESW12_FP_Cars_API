### Built With

> **[?]**
> Please provide the technologies that are used in the project.

## Getting Started

### Installation

I find it useful to have a docker network created for the compose stack. The docker-compose file uses `carApiNetwork` so run:

`docker network create carApiNetwork`

Go into the `car-api-docker` folder and build the docker images:

`docker-compose build --no-cache`

`docker-compose up`

## Why are we doing this?

The API was requested as a final project for the Software Development Bootcamp led by QA. This deliverable utilised technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, MySql, Docker and the testing suites Mockito and Junit.

## How I expected the challenge to go.
## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
## Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
## Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
## Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
## Link to Jira Board - You must add your trainer(s) as collaborators also.
